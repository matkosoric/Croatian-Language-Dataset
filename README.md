Croatian Language Dataset
=======================================================

This is a dataset of sentences on Croatian language for anyone interested in Natural Language Processing.
The dataset is Spark's dataframe in a snappy compressed ORC format.
Most of the sentences are from Croatian Wikipedia dump and OpenSubtitles project.
There are still entries that do not belong here, wheather in a form of misspelled or grammatically incorrect sentences, logs, different languages, or weird tags.
However, those should be minimal.
The goal of this project was to create a reusable dataset with standardised use of Croatian language.
